# Pizza Tower United (PLAYTESTING) FMOD Studio Project
Based of [Ralty's Pizza Tower FMOD Studio Project Recreation](https://github.com/Raltyro/Pizza-Tower-fspro-Recreation)

## Apply the Playtest Banks
To apply the banks, just run `apply-sounds.bat`, input your Pizza Tower game directory into the command prompt, and you should be good to go!

## Modifying
I'm putting this ontop because rarely most of you guys didn't do this >:(

When modifying the project, please to make sure to use the event templates that's provided in event tabs when your adding a new events, without these, the events thats been made from scratch would have unexpected changes (that is being unaffected with ingame volumes, effects, not in the right mixer bus, etc)

## Opening the project
First of all, the program that needs to open this is [FMOD Studio](https://www.fmod.com) (which what Pizza Tower uses for it's sounds),
it's free! It need to be the version above than 2.02.00. And ofcourse, you'll need to have a knowledge on how to use FMOD Studio to modify

[Here a quick Youtube Video on how to use FMOD Studio](https://youtu.be/7A1HMOsD2eU)

After installing FMOD Studio, don't open the project yet, it needs to have the Pizza Tower Assets first, to do that,
extract the Pizza Tower banks files at `sound\Desktop` to wav with the [Unofficial FMOD Banks Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12100)

Put it into the repository `Assets` folder, and you should be good to go to open this with FMOD Studio!
