# Pizza Tower FMOD Studio Project Recreation
This project/tool aims to make a improvement/fixes to the Pizza Tower sounds and to make modding sounds easier by just opening this with FMOD Studio instead of using other unofficial tools, allowing for any custom events/sounds/groups/etc to be able being added in the game!

After installing FMOD Studio, don't open the project yet, it needs to have the Pizza Tower Assets first, to do that, extract the Pizza Tower banks files at `sound\Desktop` to wav with the [Unofficial FMOD Banks Tool](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12100)

Put it into the repository `Assets` folder, and you should be good to go to open this with FMOD Studio!
